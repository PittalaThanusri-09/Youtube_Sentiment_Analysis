Recently, I’ve developed a strong interest in the IT field. I know basic Python and can solve simple logic problems, and I also have intermediate SQL knowledge. I really want to learn AI/ML and make a career in this field.

Can anyone (or the Apna College team) please suggest if there’s an EMI option for the course and how the job placement process works after completion?
Any advice or guidance from seniors would mean a lot 🙏"
